# OpenstreamdeckV2: modular and open-source
A modular 3D-printable Version of the Elgato streamdeck using 6 cherry-mx-style keyswitches(F13-F18) and a pressable KY-040 rotary encoder(volume increase, volume decrease, volume mute) as well as a RP2040 Microcontroller.

The area is divided into one bigger rectancular modul, used for 6 keyswitches and one smaller square modul, used for the rotary encoder.

To increase modularity and repairability only Jumper-Cables were used to connect to the RP2040 Microcontrollerboard.
